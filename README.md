### Greetings! üëã I'm Ruman Ali

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate software developer with a growing focus on building intelligent, scalable solutions using Python, AI, and modern backend technologies.

#### üöÄ About Me

I'm a BSCS graduate dedicated to sharpening my programming skills and staying at the edge of emerging tech. My journey in software development is fueled by curiosity, creativity, and a deep interest in solving real-world problems through code. With a solid background in the .NET Framework, I‚Äôve developed robust backend systems and desktop applications using C# and Microsoft technologies. Alongside that, I actively build mobile/web apps with Flutter and dive into Python for backend automation and AI-based solutions.

#### üíª Current Focus

I'm currently working on:
- Python for backend development and automation  
- Flutter for cross-platform mobile and web apps  
- SQL & Firebase for data management  
- .NET-based applications and APIs with C#
- Exploring AI tools and libraries like FastAPI, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
- Building efficient algorithms & sharpening problem-solving skills

I'm also actively working on algorithms and data structures to level up my problem-solving game.

#### üå± Learning Journey

I believe in continuous learning. Whether it's diving into a new framework or building a personal project, I'm always exploring ways to grow as a developer and thinker.


#### ü§ù Collaboration

I am passionate about collaborating on open-source projects and contributing to the global tech community. If you have an exciting project or idea, I'd love to discuss how we can work together to bring it to life.


#### üì´ Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rumanali) to connect, collaborate, or simply chat about all things tech! I'm always eager to engage with fellow enthusiasts and exchange ideas.


#### üòÑ Fun Fact

Outside of coding, I love observing animals, spending time with cats, and getting lost in nature üåø.
